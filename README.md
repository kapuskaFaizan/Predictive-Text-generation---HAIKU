A poem generator using Datamuse api

The structure of a traditional haiku is always the same, including the following features:

There are only three lines, totaling 17 syllables.

The first line is 5 syllables.

The second line is 7 syllables.

The third line is 5 syllables like the first.

Punctuation and capitalization are up to the poet, and need not follow the rigid rules used in structuring sentences.

A haiku does not have to rhyme, in fact usually it does not rhyme at all.

It can include the repetition of words or sounds
